      <h2>Favorite Sport/Team: Football/Eagles</h2>

      <p>Football is my favorite sport, and the Philadelphia Eagles are my favorite team for several compelling reasons, The Eagles have a history of embracing the underdog role, which resonates with me. Their historic Super Bowl victory in 2017, where they triumphed against the odds, symbolizes determination and perseverance, qualities that I admire. Growing up, my family instilled a love for the Eagles and football. Sharing the experience of watching games and attending matches with loved ones creates cherished memories and strengthens my connection to the team. <br><br> Take a second to watch my favorite Brian Dawkins clip below!</p>
